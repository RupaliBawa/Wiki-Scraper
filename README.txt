Scraping data off of Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/)

In this project, we are using Wikipedia as source for user-entered keywords,
and displaying them in a tabular format.

Scrape.py takes in the user input
and then searches through Wikipedia to source relevant pages
using urllib to get the data from Wikipedia
and BeautifulSoup to clean up said data
and then add it to View.js

View.html is used to view the data sourced by Scrape.py
